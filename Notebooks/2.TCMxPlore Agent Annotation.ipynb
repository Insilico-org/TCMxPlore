      "2. **Huang Qin (Scutellaria baicalensis)** - Has anti-inflammatory properties and can help with both IBD and headaches caused by heat.\n",
      "3. **Chuan Xiong (Ligusticum wallichii)** - Moves Qi and Blood, alleviating pain, making it suitable for headaches.\n",

      "- **Harmonize the Spleen and Stomach**: Strengthening the digestive system is crucial for managing IBD in TCM terms.\n",
      "- **Dispel Dampness**: Dampness can exacerbate IBD symptoms, so using herbs that eliminate dampness and promote diuresis can be beneficial.\n",
      "- **Move Qi and Blood**: Ensuring the smooth flow of Qi and Blood can help alleviate headache symptoms.\n",
      "- **Clear Heat**: If the headaches are associated with heat, using herbs that clear heat can provide relief.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Herbs to Avoid\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Hot and Spicy Herbs**: Such as Fu Zi (Aconitum carmichaelii) and Gan Jiang (Dried Ginger, Zingiber officinale), which can aggravate IBD symptoms by increasing heat and irritation in the intestines.\n",
      "- **Herbs that are too Cooling**: Extremely cooling herbs might exacerbate symptoms if the patient has an underlying yang deficiency or if the headaches are due to cold invasion.\n",
      "- **Herbs with Strong Laxative Properties**: Such as Da Huang (Rheum palmatum), which can irritate the bowels and worsen IBD symptoms.\n",

      "   - **Actions**: Tonifies Yuan Qi, Spleen, and Stomach Qi; generates body fluids; calms the spirit.\n",

      "   - **Contraindications**: Loose stools or diarrhea; not to be used unless there is heat.\n",

      "3. **Ma Huang (Ephedra Stem)**\n",
      "   - **Dosage**: Dry: 1.5-10g; Tincture: 1-3ml\n",
      "   - **Actions**: Induces sweating, releases the exterior, promotes urination, reduces edema.\n",
      "   - **Contraindications**: Liver Yang rising, Yin deficiency fire, pregnancy, hypertension.\n",

      "### Formula Consumption Regimen\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Recommended Dose**: Follow the individual dosages for decoction.\n",
      "- **Times Per Day**: Twice daily.\n",
      "- **Course Duration**: 10-14 days, then reassess.\n",
      "- **Time of Day**: Morning and evening.\n",
      "- **Before or After Food**: After food to minimize potential gastrointestinal discomfort.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Indications and Conditions\n",
      "\n",
      "This formula may help with conditions related to Qi deficiency, such as fatigue, digestive issues, and for the prevention of summerheat syndromes. It may also provide symptomatic relief for colds and flu by promoting sweating and reducing edema.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Actions in TCM Terms\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Ren Shen**: Tonifies Qi, particularly Yuan Qi, supporting the fundamental energy necessary for all bodily functions.\n",
      "- **Lu Dou**: Clears heat and detoxifies, particularly useful in summerheat conditions.\n",
      "- **Ma Huang**: Releases the exterior and helps with cold symptoms by promoting sweating.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Contraindications\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the patient's condition of IBD and headaches, caution is advised with Ma Huang due to its potential to exacerbate hypertension and cause restlessness, which could negatively impact IBD and headaches.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Effects on Aging Processes\n",
      "\n",
      "This formula primarily supports Qi, which in TCM is essential for all life processes. By tonifying Qi and managing body fluids, it indirectly supports the body's resistance to certain aging processes, such as energy decline and vulnerability to external pathogens.\n",

      "### Modifications\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the patient's specific needs, the following herbs are suggested:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Bai Zhu (Atractylodes macrocephala)**: Supports the spleen and stomach, aiding in digestion and addressing dampness beneficial for IBD.\n",
      "2. **Huang Qin (Scutellaria baicalensis)**: Offers anti-inflammatory properties beneficial for IBD and headaches.\n",
      "\n",
